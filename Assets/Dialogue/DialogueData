# Object : action : ID Card Name (or Any) : description

Apple : eat : Any : You walk over and decide to eat the apple. While munching you realize the apple is delicious. Praise the Apple!

Apple : eat : Patient : You walk over to the apple wanting to eat it and then... wait what was I doing? Oh right, I'm an amnesiac patient...


# ID Cards
Patient ID : inspect : Any : I walk over to the ID card and inspect it. It's a plain white card, nothing special.

Thief ID : inspect : Any : I walk over to the ID card and inspect it. A portrait of a pretty shady individual is on the card along with a number to call for 'repossession' services.
Thief ID : inspect : Guard : I walk over to the ID card and inspect it. This is clearly a thief, why would they leave this hanging around? I really hope they aren't planning to steal from us, I can't get fired again.

Brawler ID : inspect : Any : I walk over to the ID card and inspect it. The card is a bit bent and has a few scratches on it. It's a bit hard to read but the profession says 'Bar Brawler'. That can't be a real job.

Doctor ID : inspect : Any : I walk over to the ID card and inspect it. The card is pristine and has a picture of an eager doctor on it.

Guard ID : inspect : Any : I walk over to the ID card and inspect it. The card is a bit worn but still legible. It has a picture of a stern looking guard on it.
Guard ID : inspect : Thief : I walk over to the ID card and inspect it. The card is a bit worn but my keen eye can still make out the picture. This is a guard, I need to keep an eye out for them.

# Rediscover Yourself
Patient File : inspect : Any : I hold up the file. The medical jargon is too complicated to understand. Useless to me since I can t interpret it.
Patient File : inspect : Brawler : I look at the words. They start to swirl around in my vision. I stumble and fall, dropping the file. This is what I get for trying to read.
Patient File : inspect : Doctor : I scan the medical record. Relatives   unknown. Name   unknown. Age   Unknown. Why are there so many unknowns? Affliction   Amnesia. Oh, that makes more sense, how are we supposed to know if the patient doesn t know themselves. I wonder who this belongs to? The room seems to be patientless.

Permission Slip : inspect : Any : I take a look at the atrocious handwriting. It seems to be a doctors note releasing a patient from care.
Permission Slip : inspect : Patient : I look at the piece of the paper. It s the slip I got from the doctor giving me permission to leave since I finally remembered who I truly am. I just need to show this to the guards at the entrance.

# Become a bar fighter
Booze : inspect : Any : A bottle of nondescript alcohol. By the smell it must be at least 150 proof.
Booze : inspect : Doctor : A bottle of nondescript alcohol. Smells strong enough to be used as a disinfectant. No way someone is drinking this right?   Right?
Booze : inspect : Brawler: A bottle of delicious liquid sent by the gods. Now this just made my day better.

Gauze Fist Wraps : inspect : Any : I take a step closer to the gauze wraps. They are covered in fresh blood. Gross.
Gauze Fist Wraps : inspect : Doctor : I glance at the gauze wraps. They are clearly used. Great, someone left their medical waste lying around.
Gauze Fist Wraps : inspect : Brawler : Hmm. These might make punching others hurt me less.

Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Any : I pick up a battered, soggy bar loyalty card.
Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Guard : I pick up a battered, soggy bar loyalty card. Probably banned from half the bars in town, yet still working through the rewards program. Impressive.
Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Doctor : I pick up a battered, soggy bar loyalty card. Looks like this belonged to a true hardcore drinker. Wasn t there a patient that came in earlier directly from a bar?
Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Brawler : My rewards card. Only thirteen more drinks and I ll get one for free.

# Become a doctor
Labcoat : inspect : Any : I take a closer look at the labcoat. It s quite standard.
Labcoat : inspect : Doctor : My lucky labcoat. This bad boy was the only warmth during my residency.
Labcoat : inspect : Brawler : Looks like a napkin to me. Why was this in a vault?

Punchcard : inspect : Any : I hold the punchcard up to the light. Nope, no hidden messages.
Punchcard : inspect : Doctor : My punchcard. Contractually I can t leave until I get this punched.
Punchcard : inspect : Brawler : This looks pretty punchable to me.

Punchcard Punched : inspect : Any : I hold the punchcard up to the light. The large hole lets the light through, blinding me temporarily. Still no hidden messages.
Punchcard Punched : inspect : Doctor : My punchcard. Now with a nice hole clocking me out.
Punchcard Punched : inspect : Brawler : This looks like it could handle a couple more hits.

PhD : inspect : Any : A framed Doctorate. Someone must be really proud about getting this to frame it so securely.
PhD : inspect : Doctor : My framed Doctorate. Without this who really am I?

# Become a thief
Calling Card : inspect : Any : A criminal's calling card. Why would you put your face on this?
Calling Card : inspect : Guard : A criminal's calling card. Why would you put your face on this? I should keep an eye out for this person.
Calling Card : inspect : Thief : My beautiful calling card. Silian Rail lettering, 16-point cardstock, it's a classic.

The Golden Microscope : inspect : Any : A priceless golden microscope encrusted with jewels.
The Golden Microscope : inspect : Doctor : My precious golden microscope. What would I do on those long, lonely nights without it?
The Golden Microscope : inspect : Guard : The doctor's golden microscope. I told them the hospital's insurance won't cover it if it gets stolen. I hope they listen because I am not paid enough to make sure it stays safe.
The Golden Microscope : inspect : Thief : A priceless golden microscope encrusted with jewels. It should be in a museum... or in my bag.

# I am X
Donuts : inspect : Any : A box of fresh donuts, still warm.
Donuts : inspect : Doctor : A box of donuts. Too much sugar.
Donuts : inspect : Guard : A box of donuts. They seem to have been baked 3 hours 14 minutes ago. I give them a sniff. These are definitely made by Erik from Donuts Ahoy. I know I should be patrolling, but they re right here. Maybe just one.
Donuts : inspect : Thief : A box of fresh donuts. This is sure to distract any guards that can get their hands on them.

Donuts : eat : Any : I check to make sure no one is looking and quickly scarf down the box of donuts. Delicious.
Donuts : eat : Guard :  I open the box, open my throat and shove all the donuts straight to my stomach. All in a day's work.
Donuts : eat : Thief : I eat the donuts. Savoring each bite. Knowing these aren t mine made them taste so much better. Only a mastermind criminal such as myself would be able to stomach this crime, literally.
