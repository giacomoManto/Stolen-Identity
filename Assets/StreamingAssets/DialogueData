# ID Cards
Patient ID : inspect : Any : I take a look at the ID card, inspecting it closely. It's a plain white card with the words patient in big bold letters, nothing special. However, I get the feeling that I should take this with me and use it if needed.

Thief ID : inspect : Any : I take a look at the ID card, inspecting it closely. A portrait of a pretty shady individual is on the card along with a number to call for 'repossession' services.
Thief ID : inspect : Guard : I take a look at the ID card, inspecting it closely. This is clearly a thief, why would they leave this hanging around? I really hope they aren't planning to steal from us, I can't get fired again.
Thief ID : on spawn : Any : After pocketing the item, I realize that there was actually underneath it. Upon closer inspection it looks to be some sort of Thief ID card.

Brawler ID : inspect : Any : I take a look at the ID card, inspecting it closely. The card is a bit bent and has a few scratches on it. It's a bit hard to read but the profession says 'Bar Brawler'. That can't be a real job.

Doctor ID : inspect : Any : I take a look at the ID card, inspecting it closely. The card is pristine and has a picture of an eager doctor on it.

Guard ID : inspect : Any : I take a look at the ID card, inspecting it closely. The card is a bit worn but still legible. It has a picture of a stern looking guard on it.
Guard ID : inspect : Thief : I take a look at the ID card, inspecting it closely. The card is a bit worn but my keen eye can still make out the picture. This is a guard, I need to keep an eye out for them.


#Switch Dialogue
patient : switch : Any : I hold the Patient ID before me and my mind drifts in confusion and unease until suddenly… I realize maybe I'm just a hospital patient. I wonder what I'm in here for?
thief : switch : Any : I take out the Thief ID, my eyes tracing the rough portrait and fading edges. A fragment of a rebellious dream stirs within me, whispering of secrets to uncover and treasures yet to be claimed.
brawler : switch : Any : I bring forth the battered Brawler ID, its worn edges and scratches speaking plainly of past conflicts. In that moment, my mind hazes as I feel raw strength and simmer anger within me, calling me to break any obstacles in my path.
doctor : switch : Any : I gently lift the clean pristine Doctor ID, and a calming clarity envelops me. I take a cloth out of my pocket and clean off a small smudge on the ID I didn't see before. It was time to work.
guard : switch : Any : I firmly clutch the Guard ID and feel a surge of duty course through my veins. I gain a stern look as in an instant, the world sharpens into focus as the call to protect and serve resonates deep within.

# Rediscover Yourself
Patient File : inspect : Any : I hold up the file. The medical jargon is too complicated to understand. Useless to me since I can t interpret it.
Patient File : inspect : Brawler : I look at the words. They start to swirl around in my vision. I stumble and fall, dropping the file. This is what I get for trying to read.
Patient File : inspect : Doctor : I scan the medical record. Relatives   unknown. Name   unknown. Age   Unknown. Why are there so many unknowns? Affliction   Amnesia. Oh, that makes more sense, how are we supposed to know if the patient doesn't know themselves. I wonder who this belongs to? The room seems to be patientless.

Permission Slip : inspect : Any : I take a look at the atrocious handwriting. It seems to be a doctor's note releasing a patient from care.
Permission Slip : inspect : Patient : I look at the piece of the paper. It's the slip I got from the doctor giving me permission to leave since I finally remembered who I truly am. I just need to show this to the guards at the entrance.

# Become a bar fighter
Booze : inspect : Any : A bottle of nondescript alcohol. By the smell it must be at least 150 proof.
Booze : inspect : Doctor : A bottle of nondescript alcohol. Smells strong enough to be used as a disinfectant. No way someone is drinking this right?   Right?
Booze : inspect : Brawler: A bottle of delicious liquid sent by the gods. Now this just made my day better.

Gauze Fist Wraps : inspect : Any : I take a step closer to the gauze wraps. They are covered in fresh blood. Gross.
Gauze Fist Wraps : inspect : Doctor : I glance at the gauze wraps. They are clearly used. Great, someone left their medical waste lying around.
Gauze Fist Wraps : inspect : Brawler : Hmm. These might make punching others hurt me less.

Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Any : I pick up a battered, soggy bar loyalty card.
Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Guard : I pick up a battered, soggy bar loyalty card. Probably banned from half the bars in town, yet still working through the rewards program. Impressive.
Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Doctor : I pick up a battered, soggy bar loyalty card. Looks like this belonged to a true hardcore drinker. Wasn’t there a patient that came in earlier directly from a bar?
Bar Rewards Card : inspect : Brawler : My rewards card. Only thirteen more drinks and I'll get one for free.

# Become a doctor
Lab Coat : inspect : Any : I take a closer look at the lab coat. It's quite standard.
Lab Coat : inspect : Doctor : My lucky lab coat. This bad boy was the only warmth during my residency.
Lab Coat : inspect : Brawler : Looks like a napkin to me. Why was this in a vault?

Lab Coat : put on : Any : Why would I wear this. I'm not a doctor.
Lab Coat : put on : Doctor : I put on the lab coat. It feels like a second skin. Maybe I am a doctor afterall. I could live my life out like this.

Punchcard : inspect : Any : I hold the punch card up to the light. Nope, no hidden messages.
Punchcard : inspect : Doctor : My punch card. Contractually I can't leave until I get this punched.
Punchcard : inspect : Brawler : This looks pretty punchable to me.

Punchcard Punched : inspect : Any : I hold the punch card up to the light. The large hole lets the light through, blinding me temporarily. Still no hidden messages.
Punchcard Punched : inspect : Doctor : My punch card. Now with a nice hole clocking me out.
Punchcard Punched : inspect : Brawler : This looks like it could handle a couple more hits.

PhD : inspect : Any : A framed Doctorate. Someone must be really proud about getting this to frame it so securely.
PhD : inspect : Doctor : My framed Doctorate. Without this who really am I?

# This should be corkboard oops (i’ll change when I get home) 👍
coarkboard : object spawned : Any : A coarkboard with a whole bunch of notes pinned to it.
coarkboard : object spawned : Brawler : A coarkboard with a whole bunch of notes pinned to it. I quickly scan it for any information about staff bars or really just bars in the area. I don't find anything.
coarkboard : on spawn : Any : I take a closer look at the coarkboard and see a tiny little note sticking out from behind it.

Painting : inspect : Any : What looks to be a fancy oil painting, its gentle brush strokes depict some sort of jewel encrusted golden microscope. Who even comes up with this stuff?
Painting : inspect : Doctor: A wonderful painting of my golden microscope. It also perfectly hides the entrance to my vault.
Painting : inspect : Thief: A painting that's too large to steal, unfortunate.
Painting : object spawned : Any : The painting is still painted, though there's a small scratch from where I moved it off the wall. Oops?
Painting : on spawn : Any : I move the painting revealing a large metal Vault Door. Who needs one of these in a hospital?


Note : inspect : Any : I take a look at the note. Nice quality paper. It reads, "Calling all admirers of the Doctor. I have a secret staff club behind my work area. - The Janitor"
Note : inspect : Doctor : I take a look at the note. Nice quality paper. It reads, "Calling all admirers of the Doctor. I have a secret staff club behind my work area. - The Janitor". A shiver runs down my spine, I knew the janitor liked me a bit too much but I didn't think I had a fan club.

Cardboard Cutout : object spawned : Any : A cardboard cutout of a doctor. It's a bit creepy how realistic it looks.
Cardboard Cutout : on spawn : Any : Taking a closer look at the cutout I realize the Doctor ID pinned to the board is shiny, as if it's a real card and not just a printout.


Janitor's Journal : read : Any : I flip through the pages of the journal. It is filled to the brim with notes about the Doctor's daily routine. It seems the janitor has been keeping tabs on the Doctor for quite some time. The only thing that stands out to me is the doctors checklist for clocking out of their shift. <br>1. The Doctor ID Card<br>2. The Doctor’s PhD<br>3. The Doctor’s lab coat<br>4.The Doctors punched punchcard
Janitor's Journal : read : Doctor : I flip through the pages of the journal. It is filled to the brim with notes about my daily routine. This feels like an invasion of privacy. I really need to get out of this hospital if this is who my colleagues are. I especially don’t like that they stole my clocking out checklist. I haven’t been able to leave here without it. Thankfully I now remember what I need before I can clock out. <br>1. My ID<br>2. My PhD<br>3. My lab coat<br>4. My punched punchcard

Clerk : inspect : Any : Looks like the person that handles patient and employee intake. They don’t look like someone that would enjoy a conversation.
Clerk : inspect : Guard : The trustworthy hospital clerk. I only talk to them when I have to.
Clerk : inspect : Doctor : The clerk is always on my case for forgetting to punch in and out. That reminds me… nevermind.

# Become a thief

The Golden Microscope : inspect : Any : A priceless golden microscope encrusted with jewels.
The Golden Microscope : inspect : Doctor : My precious golden microscope. What would I do on those long, lonely nights without it?
The Golden Microscope : inspect : Guard : The doctor's golden microscope. I told them the hospital's insurance won't cover it if it gets stolen. I hope they listen because I am not paid enough to make sure it stays safe.
The Golden Microscope : inspect : Thief : A priceless golden microscope encrusted with jewels. It should be in a museum... or in my bag.
The Golden Microscope : location: Any : The Golden Microscope lies inside the glass case.
The Golden Microscope : take : Guard : I am NOT taking that. If the Doctor found out he would be pissed and take away my donut privileges.
The Golden Microscope : take : Brawler : That piece of junk is way too shiny, if I carried it with me there's no doubt I'd be the laughingstock of the pub.
The Golden Microscope : take : Patient : I doubt taking this would help me restore my memory. Besides, I'm no crook or thief… at least I think?

Glass Case : location : Doctor: At the back of the room lies a glass case containing my golden microscope in all its glory.
Glass Case : location : Thief: There seems to be a fairly large glass case which rests at the very back of the storage room. Whatever's inside is certain to be valuable.
Glass Case : inspect : Any : I walk over to the glass case and realize it contains… a golden microscope? I do a double take before realizing it's not a fake. The glass case itself doesn't look like its locked, which feels like a mistake considering the value of its contents.
Glass Case : inspect : Doctor: I walk over to the glass case knowing it contains my precious golden microscope. Even though I doubt the hospital insurance will cover it if it is stolen, how could I hide it away inside a safe?
Glass Case : on spawn : Any : I open up the glass case, fully revealing the golden microscope which rests inside.
Glass Case : object spawned: Any: An open glass case. There isn't really much else I can do with this.

Health Poster: location : Any : At the end of the room rests a large health poster, which is quite well centered on the wall.
Health Poster : location : Thief: At the end of the room rests a large health poster, which is poorly covering some sort of door. I could probably take it down to get to the door if I wanted to.
Health Poster : inspect : Any : I walk over to the poster and notice something strange behind it.
Health Poster : inspect : Thief: Besides the obvious <b>hidden door</b> behind the poster, the poster itself might be handmade.
Health Poster : inspect : Doctor: I look closely at the poster, realizing this is clearly hand made but well researched. Someone knows their stuff.
Health Poster : on spawn : Any : I tear away the poster, revealing a <b>hidden door</b> which has no place in a janitor's room.
Health Poster : object spawned: Any: Not much else to do with this poster.

#I am Thief
Fire Exit : thief ending : Thief : I push the cold metal bar of the fire exit and step into the night, the hospital’s sterile and tacky corridors fading behind me. I check my bag, glancing briefly at The Golden Microscope, a gleaming trophy of my legendary heist. However as I step into the night air, some part of me is still uncertain, wondering if this is who I really am.(Hidden Ending 1/4)
Exit Door : thief ending : Thief : I walk through the front of the hospital, smiling to myself as the guards are none wiser of the heist I just pulled. I check my bag, glancing briefly at The Golden Microscope, a gleaming trophy of my legendary heist. However as I step into the night air, some part of me is still uncertain, wondering if this is who I really am.(Hidden Ending 1/4)

# I am X
Donuts : inspect : Any : A box of fresh donuts, still warm.
Donuts : inspect : Doctor : A box of donuts. Too much sugar.
Donuts : inspect : Guard : A box of donuts. They seem to have been baked 3 hours 14 minutes ago. I give them a sniff. These are definitely made by Erik from Donuts Ahoy. I know I should be patrolling, but they're right here. Maybe just one.
Donuts : inspect : Thief : A box of fresh donuts. This is sure to distract any guards that can get their hands on them.

Donuts : eat : Any : I check to make sure no one is looking and quickly scarf down the box of donuts. Delicious.
Donuts : eat : Guard :  I open the box, open my throat and shove all the donuts straight to my stomach. All in a day's work.
Donuts : eat : Thief : I eat the donuts. Savoring each bite. Knowing these aren't mine made them taste so much better. Only a mastermind criminal such as myself would be able to stomach this crime, literally.

Donuts : discoverID : Any : I discover a guard ID at the bottom of the donut box. Drenched in powdered sugar it may be, it still seems useful to have around.

guards : talk : Any : I walk up to the guards and spend some time making small talk.
guards : talk : Brawler : I walk up to the guards. They give me a pretty stanky eye. I try to make small talk but they just ignore me.

guards : talk : Guard : I walk up to my fellow men in uniform. We make some small talk.

guards : talkDonuts : Any : I walk up to the guards. They really appreciate the donuts I gave them. We make some small talk.

guards : talkDonuts : Doctor : I walk up to the guards. "Are you judging us for eating the donuts YOU gave us Doctor?" the shorter one says. I chuckle and we make some small talk.
guards : talkDonuts : Thief : I sneak up to the guards eating the donuts I gave them. I use my superb thieving skills to slowly creep my arm closer to the donut box. As I try to swipe a donut the taller guard gives me a stern look.

# I am X fire escape
Fire Alarm : inspect: Any : Looks like one of those super loud fire alarms that go off once someone goes through a fire exit or if smoke is detected. I probably shouldn't mess with that unless I really have to.
Fire Alarm : inspect: Doctor: Standard hospital fire alarm, if a bit outdated. These will help keep patients and staff safe from fires.
Fire Alarm : inspect: Brawler: That thing looks breakable.
Fire Alarm : disable : Any : I fiddle with the fire alarm. Eventually I got it disabled.
Fire Alarm : disable : Doctor : I reluctantly disable the fire alarm. This goes against everything I stand for.
Fire Alarm : disable : Thief : I efficiently disable the fire alarm. Although this might make my escape easier, I can't help but feel a little guilty.

Fire Exit : go through : Patient : I push the metal bar and the door swings open. I walk through the door, leaving the hospital behind me. Is this who I really am? I just can't be sure.
Fire Exit : go through : Doctor : I push the metal bar and the door swings open. I walk through the door, leaving the hospital behind me. I guess I'll live the rest of my life out as a Doctor. I don't have the qualifications, experience or lab coat. I just can't be sure that this is really who I am.
Fire Exit : go through : Guard : I push the metal bar and the door swings open. I walk through the door, leaving the hospital behind me. Guarding doesn't sound too bad. I guess I can live the rest of my life out as a guard. I wish I could remember who I really am - but, for now, I'm satisfied just leaving the hospital.
Fire Exit : go through : Thief : I push the metal bar and the door swings open. I walk through the door, leaving the hospital behind me. Am I really a thief? It's who I am now, I guess. I just can't be sure.
Fire Exit : go through : Brawler : I push the metal bar and the door swings open. I walk through the door, leaving the hospital behind me. I head straight to the closest bar. The smell of alcohol feels like it should sit right but deep down it disgusts me.

# Doors
door : unlock : Any : The door beeps, accepting the id and I hear the deadbolt retract. I open the door and walk through.
red door : unlockFail : Any : I rattle the red door’s handle, trying to open it. It looks like it's one of those id card access doors and won't open up until I use a card.



# Brawler

Brawler : inspect : Any : I take a step closer and take a look at the brawler. Wow they are entirely muscle. They must be incredible at punching and breaking. I wonder why they are here in this ward with me.
Brawler : inspect : Doctor : Oh yes. This patient… Got so drunk at the local bar they haven’t been able to remember how to get home so they have just been staying here ever since.
Brawler : inspect : Brawler : It’s me. Wait, I’m me. But on the bed it’s me. Am I not me? Are they not them? Is my life a lie? Am I just a shell pretending to be someone else? I need a drink…badly.

Brawler : talk1 : Any : I poke the brawler waking them up. “Hey” I say. “Leave me alone before I punch you” they respond.

Brawler : talk2 : Any : I poke the brawler again. “Excuse me” I squeak out. “I have punched holes in people before. Don’t try me. And whatever you do, don't annoy me.” The brawler puts a set of ear plugs in.

Brawler : earplug : Any : I try to talk to the brawler but they have their earplugs in and (at least I think) can’t hear me.

Brawler : annoyPunchCard : Any : I foolishly decide to annoy the brawler by tickling their toes. The wake up and punch me harder than I've ever been punched before. I look down and luckily I don't have a hole in me. I check my pockets and realize my punch card took the blow for me. I guess it's a good thing I annoyed them.

Brawler : annoyNoPunchCard : Any : I tickle the brawler's feet while making a goofy face. <b><b> I wake up looking at an oddly familiar ceiling. It seems I've been punched into the next room.
